 |   attribute: predicates
 |   comments : This is the list of predicates that are considered in event correlation. An event request will
 |              be considered for deduplication only if all of these predicates are present in the request, AND
 |              if all of the predicates' values match those of a previous request.
 |
 |   attribute: suppression_period
 |   comments : An event request will be deduplicated only if a matching request was processed less than this
 |              number of seconds ago.
 |
 |   attribute: window_size
 |   comments : This is the number of non-matching events before the suppression period timer is reset.
 |              An event request will not be deduplicated if this many non-matching requests have been received
 |              within the suppression period.
